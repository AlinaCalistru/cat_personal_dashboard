# Cat Personal Dashboard Chrome extension
I have created this dashboard since I love cats and, I wanted to make something practical while using chrome for browsing. Hence the idea of putting some few details that I would like to see when I open a new tab, such as:
 - current time
 - current weather based on location
 - an interesting cat fact

 ## Technologies used
 To achieve these requirements above, I had to work with the following:
 - JavaScript to get the current time
 - Call an API to retrieve a random cat's fact in JSON format
 - Used JavaScript built-in `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` function to retrieve the current client location and pass these coordinates to
 OpenWeatherMap API.

 ## How to install
 Look on [Google Store] (https://store.google.com/) for `Cat Personal Dashboard`
